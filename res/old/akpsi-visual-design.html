				<h2>Alpha Kappa Psi - Fall Rush 2017</span></h2>
				<h4>Design Intern</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="overview">
				<p>This past summer, I was selected as a Design Intern for my fraternity, Alpha Kappa Psi, to help create the visuals for our fall rush. Our theme for this rush was “it’s your story,” with the aim of inspiring individuals to take the next step -- to write the next chapter -- of their professional and personal development.</p>
				<p>Our goal was to design physical flyers for circulation, digital displays for television advertisement and social media, table tent displays, and t-shirts. At a school the size of UCLA with over 24,000 undergraduates, it was important to capitalize on every opportunity to generate publicity. However, we soon realized, the prevalence of our presence would not matter if our designs were unable to capture potential rushees’ attention and bring together a pool of humble, motivated, and sociable individuals. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="challenges">
				<h6>Challenges</h6>
				<p>One of the biggest roadblocks we faced was not having a defined goal of our designs other than our theme. Specifically, we did not answer questions that in hindsight would have been valuable: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>What is the purpose of the design?</li>
					<li>What core values of our fraternity should be embodied in our designs?</li>
					<li>What kind of individuals are we aiming to attract?</li>
					<li>What has been effective in the past? What hasn’t?</li>
					<li>How can we differentiate this rush from the past rushes?</li>
					<li>What are our constraints? Technical skills? Time?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>These answers would have given direction to our many drafts, and allowed team members to give better feedback on whether the design met these goals. Although we had a rush campaign objective, the sources of conflicting opinions were often a result of a lack of agreement on what our designs needed to represent.</p>
				<p>Another roadblock was our lack of design experience. The team had marketing experience and a supply of ideas, but none of us had any visual designing experience or knowledge of how to use software tools, such as Photoshop or Illustrator. After a short stint, the team clearly split between those more interested in marketing and those who wanted to create the visual branding and storytelling and were interested in rapidly learning these skills; I clearly fell within the latter. And for those of us, we would have to start by learning.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="ideation">
				<h6>Ideation</h6>
				<p>I had always harbored a strong interest in visuals and their effects on an audience, so I jumped at the opportunity to learn how to use Photoshop and Illustrator through more formal online courses, as well as design gurus on YouTube. I quickly delved into Photoshop, exploring its limitless functionalities, and utilized them to create different concepts. </p>
				<p>I experimented with different concepts in my early drafts, but in each I used a combination of elements to attempt to represent the fun-loving yet hardworking and driven attitude of fraternity members. The greatest difficulty was balancing this with the theme “It’s your story” that needed to inspire a potential rushee to come out and learn more. </p>

				<p class="caption"> First few drafts: lack of direction. </p>
				<p>After taking a step back from designing and asking for input from people uninvolved with the fraternity about their initial reactions to these potential flyers, I realized that these initial flyers failed to make a strong emotional connection with people, especially people who may have no idea what the organization was about. In my second round of drafting, I focused on crafting powerful visuals through images that invoked action and success. </p>
	      <img src=".\res\images\akp-round-2.png">
				<p class="caption"> Viewers did not understand connection between fraternity and theme. </p>
				<p>While my ideas did not come to fruition, they helped the rest of the team narrow down ideas for the visual layout. With time constraints becoming more urgent, we decided to take an iconographic approach because they are universally understood symbols. We decided to make a cohesive set of five flyers, each of which signified the different themes of each day of the rush process. </p>

				<p>The next step was choosing which elements to keep united, and which elements to differentiate. The plain icons and solid colors seemed unmemorable, so we also experimented with typography, brighter colors, images, and gradients. By asking students completely unrelated to the fraternity about their reactions to the flyers, our thoughts were confirmed. The text and visuals were informative, but were not inspiring. Eventually, we combined all pieces of ideas from the prior rough drafts with the iconographic flyers to create the final products!</p>

			<div class="takeaways">
				<h6>Takeaways</h6>
				<p>The lack of experience was a drawback for the team, especially in the beginning when no one had the technical skills to produce a visual design, but the biggest setback was our lack of communication and unity about our design’s function and form and what kind of response we wanted to evoke from our target audience. In the future, before putting pencil to paper, I think that it is important to spend the time asking and answering these questions.</p>
				<p>Our final decision to stick with the clear messages of the icons demonstrated to me that the simplest design is often the most understandable, and adding one too many visual elements creates unneeded distractions. Above all, our message aimed to attract people from all backgrounds; as a result, our design had to be immediately readable before we could prioritize visual appeal. In the end, we knew that the creativity and impact of our pieces could have been stronger, but we had finally executed functionality. </p>
				<p>Personally, the lack of guidance in the creative process not only allowed me to learn Photoshop, but also to experiment with the visual elements of design composition, such as typography, color, and iconography. Working on a team taught me that everyone has different ideas of beauty, but that this disjointedness ensures that the purpose of the design is understood regardless of the audience’s background. I thoroughly enjoyed considering ideas, giving and taking critique, and tackling problems that I had never encountered before. My first design project proved to be full of mistakes and learning, and I now know what areas to focus on improving as a beginning visual communicator.</p>

			<div class="conclusion">
				<h6>Conclusion</h6>
				<p>Continuing the success of previous quarters, more than 150 rushees came out to rush week, and we received a record high number of online applications. Furthermore, this winter, I will be heading the chapter Design Committee in preparation for the rush campaign in the spring. After learning so much through this design quarter, I’m incredibly excited to begin yet again. </p>
